# 🚀 20-Day Java DSA Mastery Journey

**Jenish Dudhatra** | B.Tech CSBS @ PDPU (Pandit Deendayal Energy University), Rajkot, Gujarat | Jan 2026

Completed a **disciplined 20-day self-taught bootcamp** to master Java + core DSA patterns for internship readiness. No shortcuts — daily commits, dry runs, real LeetCode solves.

## ✅ Patterns Mastered (No Repetition)
- **Arrays & Strings**: Day04_Arrays
- **Hashing (HashMap/Set)**: Day08_PrefixSum_HashMap, Day15_GroupAnagrams
- **Sliding Window**: Day05, Day06, Day13, Day19 (LC 424 Character Replacement)
- **Two Pointers**: Day07
- **Prefix Sum**: Day08
- **Sorting**: Day09
- **Stack (Monotonic)**: Day10, Day16 (Daily Temperatures), Day17 (Next Greater Element)
- **LinkedList**: Day12
- **Binary Search on Answer**: Day18 (Koko Eating Bananas)
